Extensions allow you to add functionality to Kameo in a modular way, making it easy to build exactly the editing experience you need.

## What are extensions?

Extensions in Kameo are modular pieces of functionality that you can add to your editor. They can provide:
- **Nodes** (form fields, paragraphs, headings, etc.)
- **Marks** (bold, italic, underline, etc.)
- **Commands** (functions that modify the document)
- **Plugins**
- **Custom behaviors** and much more

## Basic extension usage

Kameo provides a `StarterKit` that includes the most common rich text features and a `FormKit` for form handling.

```javascript
import { Kameo } from '@kameo/core';
import { StarterKit } from '@kameo/starter-kit';
import { FormKit } from '@kameo/form-kit';

const kameo = new Kameo({
  element: document.querySelector('#kameo'),
  extensions: [
    StarterKit,
    FormKit,
  ],
});
```
